# Virtual Machine (VM) Exercises

## :information_source: Read this before getting started
- The two exercises should not replicate the exact actions shown in your screencast. The goal of exercises is for learners to apply what was learned in the screencasts to new problems or situations. This is best pedagogical practice for retaining and building skills. For example, this can be done by using another dataset between screencasts and exercises or focusing on a different portion of the dataset.
- We can only run free versions of BI software in our virtual machine exercises. In the case of Power BI, make sure the exercises can run on [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) without any additional paid products. 
- Unsure what the scope of an exercise should be? Here's an [example](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi/getting-started-with-power-bi?ex=14) from Introduction to Power BI. The first chapter of most DataCamp courses are free, so take a look at our [BI courses](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses?technologies=Tableau&technologies=Power%20BI) to get a feel for how we assess and guide learners.

## 1st VM Exercise

#### Dataset

- [ ] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [ ] **Initial**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-intial.twbx` or `ex-1-intial.pbix`, depending if you are auditioning for a Tableau or Power BI course.
- [ ] **Solution**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-sol.twbx` or `ex-1-sol.pbix`

#### Learning Objective

To understand the key components of the basic accounting equation as a foundation to analyzing financial statements in Power BI.

#### Context

In order to properly analyze financial statements, students need to understand the underlying components of the statements and how they interconnect. The basic accounting equation is made up of various line items from an accounting ledger. Students must understand these line items and their categorization in financial statements, precisely the income and balance sheet. Knowing this information will allow students to seamlessly create and analyze an income statement and balance sheet in Power BI.
*3 - 4 sentence description of why it’s important to learn how to do this task (linking back to the learning objective). Explain how this would be used in a real-life situation. Why is it useful, what problem does it solve?*

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Each bulleted instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task.*

- Step 1 - Open "ex-1-initial.pbix"
- Step 2 - Create a Measure to find the sum of Cash – Name it “Total Cash”
- Step 3 - Create a measure to find the sum of Accounts Receivable – Name it “Total Accounts Receivable”
- Step 4 - Create a measure to find the sum of Supplies – Name it “Supplies”
- Step 5 - Create a measure to find the sum accumulated Depreciation – Equipment – Name it “Total Accumulated Depreciation-Equipment"
- ...

#### Exercise question:
Which financial statement would these line items be reported?
- Income Statement
- Balance Sheet
- Cash Flow Statement
- Owner's Equity Statement

#### End goal:


## 2nd VM Exercise

#### Dataset

- [ ] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [ ] **Initial**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-2-intial.twbx` or `ex-2-intial.pbix`, depending if you are auditioning for a Tableau or Power BI course.
- [ ] **Solution**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-2-sol.twbx` or `ex-2-sol.pbix`

#### Learning Objective

Students will understand and the components of the balance sheet as it relates to the accounting equation.

#### Context

Learning the line items that correspond to the balance sheet is imperative in understanding how to analyze and create financial statements. Students will learn that the components of the accounting equation help them ensure that their information is correct. 

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Each bulleted instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task.*
Step 1: Create a measure to find the sum of the Equipment – Name it “ Total Equipment”
Step 2: Create a measure to find the Total Assets of Larry Automotive – Name it “Total Assets”
Step 3: Use a table to visualize all the line items in the Asset section of the Balance Sheet


#### Exercise question:
What is the most Larry Automotive's most valuable asset?
- Equipment
- Supplies
- Prepaid Insurance
- Accounts Receivable

#### End goal:

*Add an image of the final visualization here.*
